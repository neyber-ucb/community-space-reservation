# ADR 003: Notification System Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-06-11

## Context
The Community Space Reservation System requires a notification system to inform users about booking confirmations, cancellations, and other important events. We need to:

1. Send email notifications for booking events
2. Store notification history in the system
3. Allow for different notification types (email, system, etc.)
4. Ensure notifications are reliable and traceable
5. Design for future expansion to other notification channels (SMS, push notifications)

## Decision
We will implement a notification system based on the following architecture:

1. **Domain-Driven Notification Model**:
   - Notification as a first-class domain entity
   - NotificationService as a domain service defining notification operations
   - NotificationRepository interface for persistence operations

2. **Notification Types**:
   - Email notifications for immediate delivery
   - System notifications for in-app display

3. **Infrastructure Implementation**:
   - EmailNotificationService for handling email delivery
   - ActiveRecordNotificationRepository for persistence

4. **Decoupled Design**:
   - Domain services trigger notifications without knowledge of delivery mechanisms
   - Use cases coordinate between domain services and notification services
   - Repository pattern for notification persistence

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Notification logic is separate from business logic
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new notification types or delivery channels
3. **Traceability**: All notifications are stored in the database
4. **Reliability**: Notifications can be retried if delivery fails
5. **Testing**: Notification logic can be tested in isolation

### Negative
1. **Increased Complexity**: Additional components and abstractions
2. **Performance Overhead**: Database operations for each notification
3. **Synchronous Processing**: Current implementation is synchronous, which could impact API response times

## Implementation Notes
- Email notifications are currently simulated with logging in development
- Real email delivery can be implemented using ActionMailer in production
- Notification records include user_id, content, type, and read status
- Domain events could be added in the future to further decouple notification triggers
- Background processing could be added for asynchronous notification delivery

## Future Considerations
1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Move notification sending to background jobs
2. **Notification Templates**: Implement a template system for notification content
3. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to configure notification preferences
4. **Additional Channels**: Add SMS, push notifications, or other delivery channels
5. **Read Receipts**: Track when users view notifications
